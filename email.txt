I DO NOT support Free Basics in India

# Message
To the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,  I support digital equality for India.   Free Basics does NOT provide free access to essential internet services like communication, education, healthcare, employment, farming and more in an unbiased way. It DOES NOT help those who can't afford to pay for data, or who need a little help getting started online, as a REAL internet service should. And it’s NOT open to all people, developers and mobile operators, as it is dictated by few non-government over-ambitious authorities.  With 1 billion Indian people not yet connected, shutting down Free Basics would NOT hurt our country's most vulnerable people, because we have cheap internet plans in India.   I DO NOT support Free Basics – and digital inequality for India.  Thank you.
