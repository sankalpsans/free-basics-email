I support Free Basics in India

# Message
To the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,  I support digital equality for India.   Free Basics provides free access to essential internet services like communication, education, healthcare, employment, farming and more. It helps those who can't afford to pay for data, or who need a little help getting started online. And it’s open to all people, developers and mobile operators.  With 1 billion Indian people not yet connected, shutting down Free Basics would hurt our country's most vulnerable people.   I support Free Basics – and digital equality for India.  Thank you.
